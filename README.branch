# Status

Unmerged fix for EZP-21324.

Fixed the issue by creating eZImageFile references in XML during store
of the ezimage attribute.

Refactored a good part of eZImageFile, getting rid of the extra
$contentObjectAttribute optional parameter in methods, and refactoring
alias removal in smaller methods.

Replaced by #825, that fixed the issue by preventing any file from being
removed when no eZImageFile reference exists.
